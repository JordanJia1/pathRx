There is a greater emphasis on weight management as part of the holistic approach to diabetes management. The results of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes trials involving sodium – glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, including assessment of subgroups, inform broader recommendations for cardiorenal protection in people with diabetes at high risk of cardiorenal dis- ease. After a summary listing of consensus recommendations, practical tips for implementation are provided. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic complex disease, and management requires multifacto- rial behavioral and pharmacological treatments to prevent or delay complications and maintain quality of life (Fig. 1). This includes management of blood glucose lev- els, weight, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and complications. This necessi- tates that care be delivered in an organized and structured way, such as described in the chronic care model, and includes a person-centered approach to enhance en- gagement in self-care activities (1).

The expanding number of glucose-lowering interventions — from behavioral interventions to pharmacolog- ical interventions, devices, and surgery — and growing information about their ben- e fi ts and risks provide more options for people with diabetes and providers but complicate decision-making. The demon- strated bene fi ts for high-risk individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD) afforded by the glucagon- like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and sodium – glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) provide important prog- ress in treatment aimed at reducing the progression and burden of diabetes and its complications. These bene fi ts are largely independent of their glucose-lowering ef- fects. These treatments were initially in- troduced as glucose-lowering agents but are now also prescribed for organ protec- tion.

Attaining recommended glycemic tar- gets yields substantial and enduring re- ductions in the onset and progression of microvascular complications (11,12), and early intervention is essential (13). The greatest absolute risk reduction comes from improving very elevated glycemic lev- els, and a more modest reduction results from near normalization of plasma glucose levels (2,14). The impact of glucose control on macrovascular complications is less certain but is supported by multiple meta- analyses and epidemiological studies. Be- cause the bene fi ts of intensive glucose control emerge slowly while the harms can be immediate, people with longer life expectancy have more to gain from early intensive glycemic management. A reason- able HbA 1c target for most nonpregnant adults with suf fi cient life expectancy to see microvascular bene fi ts (generally \u0018 10 years) is around 53 mmol/mol (7%) or less (2). Aiming for a lower HbA 1c level than this may have value if it can be achieved safely without signi fi cant hypogly- cemia or other adverse treatment effects. A lower target may be reasonable, particu- larly when using pharmacological agents that are not associated with hypoglycemic risk. Higher targets can be appropriate in cases of limited life expectancy, advanced complications, or poor tolerability or if other factors such as frailty are present.

Language in dia- betes care should be neutral, free of stigma, and based on facts; be strength- based (focus on what is working), respect- ful, and inclusive; encourage collaboration; and be person-centered (18). People living with diabetes should not be referred to as “ diabetics ” or described as “ noncompliant ” or blamed for their health condition. Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support DSMES is a key intervention, as important to the treatment plan as the selection of pharmacotherapy (19 – 21). DSMES is cen- tral to establishing and implementing the principles of care (Fig. 1). DSMES pro- grams usually involve face-to-face contact in group or individual sessions with trained educators, and key components of DSMES are shown in Supplementary Table 1 (19 – 24). Given the ever-changing nature of type 2 diabetes, DSMES should be of- fered on an ongoing basis. Critical junc- tures when DSMES should be provided include at diagnosis, annually, when com- plications arise, and during transitions in life and care (Supplementary Table 1) (22). High-quality evidence has consistently shown that DSMES signi fi cantly improves knowledge, glycemic levels, and clinical and psychological outcomes, reduces hos- pital admissions and all-cause mortality, and is cost-effective (22,25 – 30).

DSMES is delivered through structured educational programs provided by trained diabetes care and education specialists (termed DCES in the U.S.; hereafter referred to as diabetes educators) that focus particularly on the following: lifestyle behaviors (healthy eating, physical activity, and weight man- agement), medication-taking behavior, self- monitoring when needed, self-ef fi cacy, cop- ing, and problem solving. Importantly, DSMES is tailored to the individual ’ s context, which includes their beliefs and preferences. DSMES can be provided using multiple approaches and in a variety of settings (20,31), and it is im- portant for the care team to know how to access local DSMES resources. DSMES supports the psychosocial care of people with diabetes but is not a replacement for referral for mental health services when they are warranted, for example, when di- abetes distress remains after DSMES. Psy- chiatric disorders, including disordered eating behaviors, are common, often un- recognized, and contribute to poor out- comes in diabetes (32).

Shared decision- making, facilitated by decision aids that show the absolute bene fi t and risk of alter- native treatment options, is a useful strat- egy to determine the best treatment course for an individual (42 – 45). With compelling indications for therapies such as SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA for high-risk indi- viduals with CVD, HF, or CKD, shared decision-making is essential to contextualize the evidence on bene fi ts, safety, and risks.

Weight Reduction as a Targeted Intervention Weight reduction has mostly been seen as a strategy to improve HbA 1c and re- duce the risk for weight-related complica- tions.

Glucose Management: Monitoring Glycemic management is primarily as- sessed with the HbA 1c test, which was the measure used in trials demonstrating the bene fi ts of glucose lowering (2,52). As with any laboratory test, HbA 1c mea- surement has limitations (2,52). There may be discrepancies between HbA 1c re- sults and an individual ’ s true mean blood glucose levels, particularly in certain ra- cial and ethnic groups and in conditions that alter erythrocyte turnover, such as anemia, end-stage kidney disease (espe- cially with erythropoietin therapy), and pregnancy, or if an HbA 1c assay insensi- tive to hemoglobin variants is used in someone with a hemoglobinopathy. Dis- crepancies between measured HbA 1c lev- els and measured or reported glucose levels should prompt consideration that one of these may not be reliable (52,53). Regular blood glucose monitoring (BGM) may help with self-management and medication adjustment, particularly in in- dividuals taking insulin. BGM plans should be individualized. People with type 2 dia- betes and the health care team should use the monitoring data in an effective and timely manner.

Technol- ogies such as intermittently scanned or real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provide more information and may be useful for people with type 2 dia- betes, particularly in those treated with insulin (53,56). When using CGM, standardized, single- page glucose reports, such as the ambula- tory glucose pro fi le, can be uploaded from CGM devices. They should be considered standard metrics for all CGM devices and provide visual cues for management oppor- tunities. Time in range is de fi ned as the per- centage of time that CGM readings are in the range 3.9 – 10.0 mmol/L (70 – 180 mg/dL).

Physical Activity Behaviors, Including Sleep Physical activity behaviors signi fi cantly impact cardiometabolic health in type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2) (96 – 117). Regular aero- bic exercise (i.e., involving large muscle groups and rhythmic in nature) improves glycemic management in adults with type 2 diabetes, resulting in less daily time in hyper- glycemia and reductions of \u0018 7 mmol/mol ( \u0018 0.6%) in HbA 1c (118), and induces clini- cally signi fi cant bene fi ts in cardiorespira- tory fi tness (101,110,119). These glycemic effects can be maximized by under- taking activity during the postprandial period and engaging in activities for $ 45 min (101,120). Resistance exercise (i.e., using your own body weight or working against a resistance) also improves blood glucose levels, fl exibility, and balance (101,110). This is important given the in- creased risk of impaired physical function at an earlier age in type 2 diabetes (112). A wide range of physical activities, in- cluding leisure time activities, can signi fi - cantly reduce HbA 1c levels (5,22,121,122).

Bene fi cial effects are evident across the continuum of human move- ment, from breaking prolonged sitting with light activity (103) to high-intensity interval training (123). Sleep Healthy sleep is considered a key lifestyle component in the management of type 2 diabetes (124), with clinical practice guide- lines promoting the importance of sleep hygiene (113). Sleep disorders are com- mon in type 2 diabetes and cause distur- bances in the quantity, quality, and timing of sleep and are associated with an in- creased risk of obesity and impairments in daytime functioning and glucose metabo- lism (114,115). Additionally, obstructive sleep apnea affects over half of people with type 2 diabetes, and its severity is associated with blood glucose levels (115,116).

Weight Management Beyond Lifestyle Interventions Medications for Weight Loss in Type 2 Diabetes Weight loss medications are effective ad- juncts to lifestyle interventions and healthy behaviors for management of weight and have also been found to improve glucose control in people with diabetes (127). Newer therapies have demonstrated very high ef fi cacy for weight manage- ment in people with type 2 diabetes. In the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in Peo- ple with Obesity 2 (STEP 2) trial, subcuta- neous semaglutide 2.4 mg once a week as an adjunct to a lifestyle intervention performed better than either semaglutide 1.0 mg or placebo, with weight loss of 9.6% (6.2% more than with placebo and 2.7% more than with semaglutide 1.0 mg). More than two-thirds of participants in the semaglutide 2.4-mg arm achieved an HbA 1c level of # 48 mmol/mol ( # 6.5%) (128). However, the weight loss was less pro- nounced than the 14.9% weight loss (vs. 2.4% with placebo) seen in the STEP 1 trial in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes (129).

Metabolic Surgery Metabolic surgery should be considered as a treatment option in adults with type 2 diabetes who are appropriate surgical can- didates (127,132). Metabolic surgery also appears to be effective for diabetes remis- sion in people with type 2 diabetes and a BMI $ 25 kg/m 2 , although ef fi cacy for both weight loss and diabetes remission appears to vary by surgical type (133 – 135).

People with more re- cently diagnosed diabetes are more likely to experience remission after metabolic surgery, and the likelihood of remission decreases signi fi cantly with duration of di- abetes longer than about 5 – 8 years (138). Even in people with diabetes who do not achieve postoperative diabetes remission, or relapse after initial remission, metabolic surgery is associated with better metabolic control than medical management (137, 139). In the Surgical Treatment and Medi- cations Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Ef fi - ciently (STAMPEDE) trial, metabolic surgery was also associated with improvements in patient-reported outcomes related to phys- ical health; however, measures of social and psychological quality of life did not im- prove (140).

Their use is associated with in- creased risk for mycotic genital infections, which are reported to be typically mild and treatable. While SGLT2i use can in- crease the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the incidence is low, with a modest incremental absolute risk (142). The SGLT2i cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have reported DKA rates of 0.1 – 0.6% compared with rates of < 0.1 – 0.3% with placebo (143 – 147), with very low rates in the HF (148 – 151) and CKD (152,153) outcome studies. Risk can be mitigated with edu- cation and guidance, including education on signs and symptoms of DKA that should prompt medical attention, and temporary discontinuation of the medica- tion in clinical situations that predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g., during prolonged fasting and acute illness and perioperatively, i.e., 3 days prior to surgery) (154 – 158).

Analyses of SGLT2i outcome trial data also suggest that peo- ple with type 2 diabetes and peripheral arterial disease derive greater absolute outcome bene fi ts from SGLT2i therapy than those without peripheral arterial dis- ease, without an increase in risk of major adverse limb events (162). In post hoc analyses, SGLT2i use has been associated with reduced incidence of serious and nonserious kidney-related adverse events in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD and greater full recovery from acute kid- ney injury (163).

Because of its high ef fi cacy in lowering HbA 1c , minimal hypoglyce- mia risk when used as monotherapy, weight neutrality with the potential for modest weight loss, good safety pro fi le, and low cost, metformin has traditionally been recommended as fi rst-line glucose- lowering therapy for the management of type 2 diabetes.

Metformin should not be used in people with an eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , and dose reduction should be considered when the eGFR is < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (177). Metformin use may result in lower serum vitamin B 12 concentrations and worsening of symptoms of neuropathy; therefore, periodic monitoring and supple- mentation are generally recommended if levels are de fi cient, particularly in those with anemia or neuropathy (178,179).

While generally well tolerated, an increased risk of HHF was found with saxagliptin, which is re fl ected in its label, and there have been rare reports of ar- thralgia and hypersensitivity reactions with the DPP-4i class (16). The high tolerability and modest ef fi - cacy of DPP-4i may mean that they are suitable for speci fi c populations and con- siderations. For example, in a 6-month open-label RCT comparing a DPP-4i (lina- gliptin) with basal insulin (glargine) in long-term care and skilled nursing facili- ties, mean daily blood glucose was simi- lar, with fewer hypoglycemic events with linagliptin compared with insulin (181).

For HbA 1c , placebo-adjusted reductions of 21 mmol/mol (1.91%), 21 mmol/mol (1.93%), and 23 mmol/mol (2.11%) were demonstrated with tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg weekly, respectively, and mean weight reductions of 7 – 9.5 kg were seen (183). Additional metabolic bene fi ts in- cluded improvements in liver fat content and reduced visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue volume (188). Based on meta-analysis fi ndings, tirzepa- tide was superior to its comparators, in- cluding other long-acting GLP-1 RA, in reducing glucose and body weight, but was associated with increased odds for gastrointestinal adverse events, in partic- ular nausea (189).

Tirzepatide has received a positive opinion in the European Union (EU). Sulfonylureas. As per the previous con- sensus report and update, sulfonylureas are assessed as having high glucose- lowering ef fi cacy, but with a lack of du- rable effect, and the advantages of be- ing inexpensive and accessible (5,6). However, due to their glucose-indepen- dent stimulation of insulin secretion, they are associated with an increased risk for hypoglycemia. Sulfonylureas are also associated with weight gain, which is relatively modest in large cohort stud- ies (191). Use of sulfonylureas or insulin for early intensive blood glucose control in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) signi fi cantly decreased the risk of microvascular complications, under- scoring the importance of early and continued glycemic management (192).

Adverse cardiovascular outcomes with sulfonylureas in some observational stud- ies have raised concerns, although fi nd- ings from systematic reviews have found no increase in all-cause mortality rates compared with other active treatments (191). The incidence of cardiovascular events was comparable in those treated with a sulfonylurea or pioglitazone in the Thiazolidinediones or Sulfonylureas and Cardiovascular Accidents Intervention Trial (TOSCA.IT) (193), and no difference in the incidence of MACE was found in people at high cardiovascular risk treated with gli- mepiride or linagliptin (194), a medication whose cardiovascular safety was demon- strated in a population at high cardiovas- cular and renal risk (195). Thiazolidinediones. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are oral medications that increase insulin sensitivity and are of high glu- cose-lowering ef fi cacy (5,6).

Bene fi cial effects on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) have been seen with pioglitazone (200,201). However, these bene fi ts must be balanced against possible side effects of fl uid retention and congestive HF (196,197,202), weight gain (196 – 198,202,203), and bone fracture (204,205). Side effects can be mitigated by using lower doses and combining TZD therapy with other medications (SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA) that promote weight loss and sodium excretion (199,206). Insulin. The previous consensus report and update provide detailed descriptions of the different insulins (5,6).

Starting doses of basal insulin (NPH or analog) are estimated based on body weight (0.1 – 0.2 units/kg per day) and the degree of hyperglycemia, with indi- vidualized titration as needed. A modest but signi fi cant reduction in HbA 1c and the risk of total and nocturnal hypogly- cemia has been observed for basal insu- lin analogs versus NPH insulin (210). Longer-acting basal insulin analogs have a lower risk of hypoglycemia than earlier generations of basal insulin, although they may cost more. Concentrated insu- lins allow injection of a reduced volume (5). Cost and access are important consid- erations and can contribute to treatment discontinuation.

Combination Therapy The underlying pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes is complex, with multiple con- tributing abnormalities resulting in a natu- rally progressive disease and increasing HbA 1c over time in many. While tradi- tional recommendations have focused on the stepwise addition of therapy, allowing for clear delineation of positive and nega- tive effects of new drugs, there are data to suggest bene fi ts of combination ap- proaches in diabetes care. Combination therapy has several potential advan- tages, including 1 ) increased durability of the glycemic effect (225 – 227), address- ing therapeutic inertia, 2 ) simultaneous targeting of the multiple pathophysiolog- ical processes characterized by type 2 di- abetes, and 3 ) impacts on medication burden, medication-taking behavior, and treatment persistence, and 4 ) comple- mentary clinical bene fi ts (e.g., on glyce- mic control, weight and cardiovascular risk pro fi les) (215,228 – 244).

PERSONALIZED APPROACH TO TREATMENT BASED ON INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND COMORBIDITIES: RECOMMENDED PROCESS FOR GLUCOSE-LOWERING MEDICATION SELECTION People With Cardiorenal Comorbidities The 2018 ADA/EASD consensus report and 2019 update focused on the consid- eration of clinically important factors when choosing glucose-lowering ther- apy.

Notably, this bene fi - cial effect of empagli fl ozin regardless of diabetes status was consistently evident in those with a preserved ejection frac- tion ( > 40%), as demonstrated in the Empagli fl ozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Pre- served Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-Pre- served) (151). Additionally, the Effect of Sotagli fl ozin on Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Post Wors- ening Heart Failure (SOLOIST-WHF) trial showed that, in people with type 2 diabetes and worsening HF, sotagli fl ozin reduced the total number of cardiovascu- lar deaths or hospitalizations or urgent visits for HF compared with placebo re- gardless of ","tf":{"40":1,"50":1,"147":1,"149":1,"151":1,"in":11,"people":4,"with":12,"type":4,"diabetes":5,"who":1,"had":2,"ckd":1,"and":3,"additional":1,"cardiovascu":2,"lar":2,"risk":1,"factors":1,"sotagli":3,"fl":7,"ozin":7,"reduced":6,"the":8,"composite":3,"end":3,"point":3,"of":10,"cardiovascular":3,"mortality":2,"hhf":2,"or":4,"urgent":2,"visits":2,"for":2,"hf":6,"compared":2,"placebo":2,"but":1,"no":1,"effect":3,"on":2,"kidney":1,"sglt2i":1,"have":1,"been":1,"recently":1,"assessed":1,"dedicated":1,"out":2,"come":2,"trials":1,"empagli":4,"trial":3,"patients":3,"chronic":2,"heart":3,"failure":3,"ejection":4,"fraction":3,"emperor":2,"primary":1,"irrespective":1,"presence":1,"participants":1,"notably":1,"this":1,"bene":1,"fi":1,"cial":1,"regardless":1,"status":1,"was":1,"consistently":1,"evident":1,"those":1,"preserved":1,"frac":1,"tion":1,"as":1,"demonstrated":1,"outcome":1,"pre":2,"served":2,"additionally":1,"events":1,"post":1,"wors":1,"ening":1,"soloist":1,"whf":1,"showed":1,"that":1,"worsening":1,"total":1,"number":1,"deaths":1,"hospitalizations":1,"re":1,"gardless":1},"len":219},{"docId":"ada-easd-2022","docTitle":"ADA/EASD Consensus 2022","file":"ada-easd-2022.pdf","page":15,"chunkId":"ada-easd-2022-p15-c2","text":"ing Heart Failure (SOLOIST-WHF) trial showed that, in people with type 2 diabetes and worsening HF, sotagli fl ozin reduced the total number of cardiovascu- lar deaths or hospitalizations or urgent visits for HF compared with placebo re- gardless of ejection fraction (150). All these data corroborate the salutary drug class effects of SGLT2i on HF-related out- comes in the setting of HF, irrespective of ejection fraction or diabetes status. Finally, among GLP-1 RA, the Effect of Efpeglenatide on Cardiovascular Out- comes (AMPLITUDE-O) trial demonstrated a bene fi cial effect of weekly efpeglenatide on MACE and on a composite kidney out- come (decrease in kidney function or se- vere albuminuria) (247). Of note, an exploratory analysis suggested a possible dose – response effect of efpeglenatide on MACE. In a CVOT of an osmotic minipump delivering exenatide subcutaneously (ITCA 650) over 3 – 6 months, ITCA 650 had a neutral effect on MACE compared with placebo over 16 months (248). Both trials recruited individuals with type 2 diabetes with an established, or high, risk for CVD. Neither efpeglenatide nor ITCA 650 has received marketing authorization by the FDA or European Medicines Agency.

As mentioned previously, the cardiovascular effects of tirzepatide are being assessed in the ongoing SURPASS-CVOT trial, with du- laglutide as an active comparator. Evidence is emerging regarding the potential bene fi ts of combined treat- ment with both an SGLT2i and a GLP-1 RA on outcomes. A post hoc analysis of data from the Exenatide Study of Cardio- vascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) has suggested that the combination of exe- natide once weekly (EQW) plus open- label SGLT2i reduces all-cause mortality rates and attenuates the decline in eGFR compared with treatment with EQW alone (244). Importantly, a prespeci fi ed explor- atory analysis of the AMPLITUDE-O trial found comparable bene fi ts of GLP-1 RA treatment in participants who were receiv- ing an SGLT2i as background therapy (15% of the total trial population) and those who were not (241). Results From Evidence Syntheses Recent cardiovascular, kidney, and HF out- come trials have been incorporated in up- dated meta-analyses assessing SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA, both in the overall trial popula- tions and in clinically relevant subgroups.

Pairwise meta-analyses of SGLT2i CVOTs veri fi ed that SGLT2i reduced MACE, HHF, and a composite kidney outcome in the overall population versus placebo (142,249). Regarding GLP-1 RA, a meta- analysis of relevant CVOTs demonstrated the favorable effect of GLP-1 RA versus placebo on MACE and its individual com- ponents, including stroke, HHF, and a composite kidney outcome including se- vere albuminuria (250,251). It should be noted, however, that the overall effect estimate for HHF seems to have been driven by CVOTs of albiglutide and efpe- glenatide, which are not available for clinical use. Similarly, the overall effect estimate for the composite kidney out- come was most likely driven by the ef- fect of GLP-1 RA on severe albuminuria only and not on hard kidney end points. Of note, the bene fi cial kidney effects of canagli fl ozin, dapagli fl ozin, and empagli- fl ozin were also evident for hard kidney outcomes, including chronic dialysis and kidney transplantation (252). When indi- vidual components of MACE were ana- lyzed separately, GLP-1 RA reduced all three outcomes, with a more pronounced effect on stroke followed by cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction (253,254).

The applicability of data to support selection of subgroups has been ques- tioned because of a lack of RCTs focus- ing on speci fi c populations, such as those using versus those not using met- formin. This has been examined in sub- group analyses of recent meta-analyses (6). It should be noted that fi ndings of subgroup analyses should not be re- garded as conclusive, their credibility should always be formally assessed, and ideally they should be complemented by fi ndings from relevant RCTs (7,8). Re- cently published subgroup analyses have explored the role of background use of metformin as a potential effect modi fi er of cardiovascular bene fi t. For SGLT2i, no differences were observed in MACE, car- diovascular death or HHF, major kidney outcomes, and mortality rates in those using versus those not using metformin (174). Further, for GLP-1 RA, no differ- ences were shown in MACE and mortal- ity outcomes (256 – 258) in metformin users compared with nonusers.

Furthermore, in terms of absolute effects, the cardiovascu- lar bene fi ts of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i were less pronounced in people with three or more cardiovascular risk factors than in those with established CVD. This was shown in a network meta-analysis that es- timated the absolute effects of treatment with GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i on cardiovascu- lar and kidney outcomes for different categories of baseline cardiovascular risk by combining relative effect estimates with baseline risk estimates (259). Subgroup meta-analyses based on par- ticipants ’ kidney function indicated that the salutary effects of SGLT2i on MACE, cardiovascular death or HHF, and a com- posite kidney outcome (substantial loss of kidney function, end-stage kidney disease, or death due to kidney disease) do not sig- ni fi cantly differ among subgroups based on eGFR (142,252).

In addition, no modi fi cation of the effect estimates for MACE, cardiovascular death or HHF, and the composite kidney outcome was ob- served for SGLT2i in subgroup meta- analyses based on history of HF (142). Regarding GLP-1 RA, a subgroup meta- analysis found that their effect on MACE did not signi fi cantly differ between peo- ple with an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and those with an eGFR $ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (253). Moreover, the effect on MACE did not appear to differ be- tween people with lower and higher HbA 1c at baseline, both for SGLT2i and for GLP-1 RA (142,253).

How- ever, the comparative effectiveness of the two drug classes has been assessed in three recent network meta-analyses, which found that, in people with type 2 diabetes, SGLT2i were superior to GLP-1 RA in reducing HHF and a composite kidney outcome, while GLP-1 RA seemed more ef fi cacious in reducing the risk of stroke (223,259,260). No important dif- ferences between the two drug classes were evident in terms of mortality rates and other cardiovascular outcomes. These conclusions are further supported by ob- servational data from a large population- based cohort study in the U.S., which showed that SGLT2i reduced HHF com- pared with GLP-1 RA in people both with CVD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71; 95% CI 0.64, 0.79) and without CVD (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56, 0.81).

Additional Clinical Considerations Age: Older People With Diabetes Type 2 diabetes represents a model of accelerated biological ageing. As such, type 2 diabetes is associated with de- clines in physical capacity, underpinned by dysfunction within skeletal muscle. The ability of people with type 2 diabe- tes to undertake simple functional exer- cises in middle age has been shown to be like those at least a decade older within the general population. Impor- tantly, this places people living with type 2 diabetes at a high risk of impaired physical function and frailty, which in turn reduces quality of life and increases health care use.

As such, frailty is increasingly recog- nized as a major complication of type 2 diabetes and an important target for treatment (112,262). Informed decisions regarding treat- ment of older ( > 65 years) adults with diabetes are limited by the underrepre- sentation of such participants in clinical trials. When older individuals have been studied, analyses from trials such as Ac- tion in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) suggested that more frail individuals have worse out- comes and bene fi t less from intensive control of blood glucose levels and blood pressure (263). However, our con- fi dence in selecting medications to im- prove outcomes has improved, in part because of regulatory requirements to include older people in trials to deter- mine the ef fi cacy and safety of new drugs for diabetes (264,265).

Therefore, recommen- dations for the selection of medications to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes do not differ for older people. Older age should not be an obstacle to treatment of individuals with established or high risk for CVD. However, medica- tion choices for people who are frail or who have multiple comorbidities may re- quire modi fi cation for safety and tolera- bility. People with diabetes should also understand and be able to appropriately modify use of their prescribed medica- tions during times of illness. Frailty is as- sociated with poorer prognosis, and some attenuation of bene fi t from intensive glu- cose-lowering and blood pressure-lower- ing treatments has been demonstrated in frail individuals (263).

A meta-analysis of six large cardiovascular and kidney out- come trials found that non-White partici- pants had higher rates of cardiovascular and other comorbidities than the White cohort but comprised only about 21% of the overall enrolled trial populations. Im- portantly, both non-White and White sub- groups had signi fi cant reductions in the risk of cardiovascular death or HHF with SGLT2i therapy compared with placebo (odds ratio 0.66 and 0.82, respectively) (277). The increased burden of complica- tions in underrepresented populations with diabetes should be factored into per- sonalized treatment plans, and bene fi cial medications should be used irrespective of race or ethnicity.

Diabetes signi fi cantly in- creases the risk of cardiovascular compli- cations in both sexes, and CVD causes most hospitalizations and deaths in women and men with diabetes (280,281). In the general population, women are at lower risk for cardiovascular events than men of the same age; however, this vas- cular protection or advantage is reduced in women who develop type 2 diabetes (282,283). In fact, the increase in relative risk of CVD due to type 2 diabetes is greater in women than in men (284 – 286). Despite this, women have been underrep- resented in recent CVOTs in diabetes, com- prising between 28.5 and 35.8% of participants (287). This analysis also de- scribed differing patterns of cardiovascular complications in women compared with men and poorer management of cardio- vascular risk factors in women (287).

Although SGLT2i therapy has also been shown to reduce elevated levels of liver enzymes and he- patic fat content in people with NAFLD, at this time there is less evidence to support use of this class of drug as treatment for NASH (300 – 302). NAFLD, and in particular NASH, is also associ- ated with an increased risk of cardiovas- cular complications; therefore, people with NAFLD should have their cardiovas- cular risk factors assessed and managed to minimize this risk (303).

The man- agement approach must be holistic and multifactorial and account for the life- long nature of type 2 diabetes (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). The person living with type 2 diabetes should be at the center of care. The structure and organization of the health care team will vary across systems but generally involves multiple disciplines, including the primary care provider, diabetologist, diabetes care and education specialist, registered die- titian/nutritionist, pharmacists, nurses, and other specialists as needed (e.g., den- tist, eye care professional, podiatrist, mental health provider, cardiologist, nephrologist, neurologist, hepatologist, sleep medicine specialist, and pain management specialist) (306).

Attention should be given to how the bal- ance of risks and bene fi ts of each inter- vention is communicated to each person living with diabetes. Risk estimator tools, especially for CVD risk, may also be help- ful, but when using these tools one must be aware that they work best when they are derived from and/or are validated in a population similar to the population in which they are applied (307). These risk estimator tools are often developed in populations that exclude younger and older people and underrepresent women and various minority populations. Finally, shared decision-making is essential to in- corporating an individual ’ s preferences and values when formulating a manage- ment plan. Social determinants of health must be as- sessed and addressed (47) to achieve health equity in diabetes. Health systems must en- sure equity in the delivery of all diabetes care, including access to the more expen- sive, organ-protecting pharmacotherapies (SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs) and technologies (e.g., CGM).

Attention to these comorbid- ities should be paid throughout the life span of the person living with diabetes, as such comorbidities may impact the tai- loring and implementation of the holistic plan for diabetes management, including choice of glucose-lowering medication. Importantly, diabetes is associated with cognitive decrements, which can substan- tially impact management (308,309). Fur- ther, long-term hyperglycemia is associated with worsening cognitive decline. Screening for cognitive impairment should be per- formed when risk factors are identi fi ed, such as frequent hypoglycemia, dif fi - culty with diabetes self-management, or unexplained falls.

Practical Tips for Clinicians • Consider each person living with dia- betes an individual with speci fi c con- text, risks, and preferences. • Health care systems should monitor and address inequity in the delivery of evidence-based interventions for type 2 diabetes. • Assess and address social determi- nants of health for each individual liv- ing with diabetes, particularly in those not achieving goals. • Incorporate comorbidities when de- veloping and implementing the man- agement plan. See Supplementary Fig. 1. Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support DSMES is critical to integrated, holistic, person-centered care in type 2 diabetes (19 – 21,23) and is as important to the management plan as the selection of medication. DSMES should be offered on an ongoing basis, should be provided by trained diabetes care and education specialists, and can be delivered using multiple approaches and in a variety of settings (Supplementary Table 1) (20,31).

All individuals with type 2 diabetes should be offered MNT to develop a personal food plan in the context of dia- betes. The need for additional dietary advice should be reevaluated over time (310). There is no single dietary pattern recommended for all individuals with type 2 diabetes; many dietary patterns can be effective for achieving treatment goals, and a structured food plan should be based on an individual person ’ s pref- erences and context. Explicit physical activity and minimi- zation of sedentary time should be the focus of the physical activity regimen for people living with type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). Individual preferences and cir- cumstances should inform the speci fi c activity regimen. A reasonable target for physical activity is at least 150 min/week. In addition to these activity minutes, breaking up sedentary time with activity breaks (e.g., 5-min activity break every hour) can be bene fi cial (101).

Practical Tips for Clinicians • Speci fi c health behavior and weight management goals should be agreed on between the person with type 2 dia- betes and the care team; shared deci- sion-making is an important component of this discussion. • Emphasize self-monitoring behaviors and review data collected (e.g., glu- cose monitoring, weight, tracking phys- ical activity) in clinical visits to convey their importance in achieving the de- sired health behavior goals. • People taking insulin or a sulfonylurea should be educated about the risk, symptoms, and treatment of hypogly- cemia when undertaking physical ac- tivity or adopting a speci fi c nutritional plan; prescribe glucagon in people at risk for severe hypoglycemia. • DSMES and MNT can help the person","tf":{"93":1,"311":1,"312":1,"oals":1,"are":1,"more":1,"effec":1,"tive":1,"for":3,"achieving":2,"behavior":5,"change":2,"than":1,"nonspeci":1,"fi":4,"recommendations":1,"an":2,"all":1,"or":4,"none":1,"approach":1,"related":1,"to":4,"behav":1,"ioral":1,"goals":5,"should":3,"be":4,"avoided":1,"as":2,"any":1,"im":1,"provement":1,"in":6,"healthy":1,"behaviors":2,"can":3,"have":1,"positive":1,"impact":1,"diabetes":2,"self":2,"monitoring":4,"of":6,"achievements":1,"physical":2,"activity":2,"and":6,"weight":3,"measure":1,"ment":1,"is":2,"crucial":1,"the":8,"achievement":1,"health":4,"fig":1,"behavioral":1,"specialists":1,"psychologists":1,"with":3,"speci":3,"training":1,"inter":1,"ventions":1,"particular":1,"value":1,"members":1,"team":2,"help":2,"person":3,"type":2,"achieve":1,"practical":1,"tips":1,"clinicians":1,"management":1,"agreed":1,"on":1,"between":1,"dia":1,"betes":1,"care":1,"shared":1,"deci":1,"sion":1,"making":1,"important":1,"component":1,"this":1,"discussion":1,"emphasize":1,"review":1,"data":1,"collected":1,"glu":1,"cose":1,"tracking":1,"phys":1,"ical":1,"clinical":1,"visits":1,"convey":1,"their":1,"importance":1,"de":1,"sired":1,"people":2,"taking":1,"insulin":1,"sulfonylurea":1,"educated":1,"about":1,"risk":2,"symptoms":1,"treatment":1,"hypogly":1,"cemia":1,"when":1,"undertaking":1,"ac":1,"tivity":1,"adopting":1,"nutritional":1,"plan":1,"prescribe":1,"glucagon":1,"at":1,"severe":1,"hypoglycemia":1,"dsmes":1,"mnt":1},"len":209},{"docId":"ada-easd-2022","docTitle":"ADA/EASD Consensus 2022","file":"ada-easd-2022.pdf","page":21,"chunkId":"ada-easd-2022-p21-c2","text":"ld be educated about the risk, symptoms, and treatment of hypogly- cemia when undertaking physical ac- tivity or adopting a speci fi c nutritional plan; prescribe glucagon in people at risk for severe hypoglycemia. • DSMES and MNT can help the person living with diabetes to identify and ad- dress barriers to implementing health- ier behaviors. See Supplementary Fig. 2. Choice of Glucose-Lowering Medication The choice of glucose-lowering agents should be directed by the individual pro fi le of the person with type 2 diabe- tes, in particular the presence of comor- bidities, risk of side effects, preferences, and context (Figs. 3 and 4). Pharmaco- logical treatment of hyperglycemia must be integrated in DSMES and accompa- nied by a focus on healthy behaviors from diagnosis onwards. This should be integrated as part of a holistic, multifac- torial approach to type 2 diabetes that includes weight, blood pressure, and lipid management (Fig. 4). Whereas the pursuit of glycemic con- trol and the pursuit of organ-speci fi c (e.g., heart and kidney) protection are complementary and not mutually exclu- sive, clinicians should not confuse the discussion of choice of agents for their glucose-lowering effect with the discus- sion of choice of speci fi c agents for their direct organ-protecting effect.

Special attention needs to be given to populations in which hypoglycemia is most dangerous, for example, people with frailty, in whom agents without risk of hypoglycemia need to be prioritized. If sulfonylureas or insulin are used, consid- eration of less stringent targets in such settings is prudent and deprescribing if asymptomatic or severe hypoglycemia ensues.

Moreover, the path- ophysiology of micro- and macrovascular damage shares more commonality than usually thought, suggesting that the pre- vention of microvascular disease may, in the long term, contribute to a reduction in macrovascular complications as well (317).

Whereas solid evidence exists for combining SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA for weight and glucose lowering, emerging data suggest promise for com- bined effects on cardiorenal outcomes (228). As more medications are added, there is an increased treatment burden and risk of adverse effects. It is important to con- sider medication interactions and whether regimen complexity may become an obstacle to adherence. Fixed-dose combi- nation preparations can improve medica- tion-taking behaviors. Finally, with each additional medication comes increased costs, which can affect medication-taking behavior and medication effectiveness (318 – 326).

Basal insulins are typically administered before bedtime, but, with newer analogs, more fl exibility in the timing of insulin injection is possi- ble (i.e., any time of the day). In some, as the disease progresses, despite titration of the basal insulin to correct fasting hyperglycemia (typically more than 0.5 U/kg), mealtime insulin may have to be added to meet glycemic targets, particularly postprandial glucose (328). Mealtime insulin may be required to enhance postprandial blood glucose levels and achieve HbA 1c targets. Thera- peutic inertia in intensi fi cation of insulin therapy should be avoided, and, when clinicians are not familiar with multiple daily injection therapy, referral to special- ist care and/or DSMES is warranted. A straightforward way to introduce meal- time insulin is to start with a short- or rapid-acting insulin injection before the meal associated with the largest glucose excursion.

Another simpler and still popular way of combining mealtime and basal insulin components is using premixed insulins. Insulin analog-based combinations have the advantage of re- sulting in fewer hypoglycemic events and weight gain than are typically ob- served with human premixed insulin (330). Finally, it needs to be reemphasized that, in all insulin-treated people with type 2 diabetes, agents associated with cardiorenal protection or weight reduction should be kept in the treatment regimen whenever possible (331). The combination of a basal insulin analog and GLP-1 RA in one injection may be a simple way to re- duce the burden and complexity of treat- ment (332).

Place of Technology The use of technology in the therapy of people with type 2 diabetes is increasing through a broad range of approaches, for example, telehealth, remote monitor- ing systems, CGM, and behavioral aids to support physical activity, meal planning and monitoring, medication-taking be- havior, mindfulness, and stress manage- ment. Evidence on the impact of these systems is variable and highly dependent on the embedding of the technology in a more comprehensive approach. Evidence for a bene fi cial impact of telehealth on achieving treatment goals in those living with type 2 diabetes is growing (333,334). During the COVID-19 pandemic, tele- health has proven to be an ef fi cient way of overseeing the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes.

For those needing insulin as part of their treatment, smart insulin pens and insulin pumps (continuous subcutane- ous insulin infusion [CSII]) are available. Speci fi c evidence on the bene fi t of smart pens in people with type 2 diabe- tes is still scarce. CSII use is associated with small improvements in HbA 1c and fewer hypoglycemic events, suggesting that CSII can be considered in people living with type 2 diabetes treated with multiple daily insulin injections and able to manage the device (71). Again, for optimal effect, this technology should be embedded in an integrated approach to type 2 diabetes therapy, speci fi cally to avoid weight gain (335). In individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin, CGM, both intermit- tently scanned CGM and real-time CGM, has gained traction, with evidence that CGM results in better overall glucose con- trol as de fi ned by HbA 1c and time in range (3.9 – 10.0 mmol/L [70 – 180 mg/dL]), fewer hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes, and improvements in diabetes distress (336,337).

Finally, to date, no convincing evidence is available on the use of hybrid closed- loop systems speci fi cally in people with type 2 diabetes. Practical Tips for Clinicians • Technology can be useful in people with type 2 diabetes but needs to be part of a holistic plan of care and sup- ported by DSMES. • Consider CGM in people with type 2 diabetes on insulin. • Adapt the clinic/system to optimize ef- fective use of technology among peo- ple with type 2 diabetes, particularly to support behavior change through self-monitoring.

Across the spectrum from highly controlled trials to ob- servational studies, paying greater attention to subgroups, in particular vulnerable populations, is essential.

Data are re- quired to better inform when to select a GLP-1 RA and/or an SGLT2i in the setting of CVD but without HF or CKD and to fully validate the recommenda- tion for combination therapy in those at high risk who do not meet glycemic targets. As discussed, there is consider- able uncertainty about the absolute bene fi ts of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i for CVD outcomes in those with risk fac- tors only. As a result, there is variabil- ity in the recommendations on how to de fi ne high-risk people with diabetes, to whom these disease-modifying agents should be prescribed to have the greatest bene fi t/impact. As all people with diabetes are at high risk of CVD, HF, and CKD over time, real- world evidence and cost-effectiveness studies of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i in broad populations would help to bet- ter target interventions to have the greatest impact on outcomes. • Glucose monitoring. Further studies to understand the role and optimal im- plementation of CGM and/or episodic CGM in type 2 diabetes are needed. • Comorbidities.

Cognitive impair- ment is a major burden to people with diabetes, their families, and society; better understanding of the pathophys- iology and the impact of interventions is a challenging but high-reward area for investigation. There are virtually no data to inform best practice in the care of people with diabetes and ad- vanced CKD, particularly in dialysis- dependent kidney disease. Additional studies, particularly of GLP-1 RA, GIP and GLP-1 RA, and SGLT2i, will hope- fully provide new avenues to reduce mortality in this population, in which there are enormous health disparities. • Screening and prevention. Screening for diabetes and its complications and comorbidities remains inadequate. Early intervention to prevent progres- sion is also generally suboptimal. Na- tional health care systems should comprehensively assess the imple- mentation of recommendations and create incentives for effective pro- grams.

Further studies are needed to understand behavioral sleep therapy and its bene fi ts more fully as well as the bene fi ts of medication and device aids. As chronotype is poten- tially modi fi able, future research should focus on social and lifestyle factors to optimize interventional responses.

Combined with consistent efforts to improve health behaviors (nutri- tion, activity, sleep, and self-monitoring) and to provide DSMES, these form the foundation of diabetes management.

PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES Recommendations 9.1 Treat most adults with type 1 diabetes with continuous subcutaneous insulin in - fusion or multiple daily doses of prandial (injected or inhaled) and basal insulin. A 9.2 For most adults with type 1 diabetes, insulin analogs (or inhaled insulin) are preferred over injectable human insulins to minimize hypoglycemia risk. A 9.3 To improve glycemic outcomes and quality of life and to minimize hypo - glycemia risk, most adults with type 1 diabetes should receive education on how to match mealtime insulin doses to carbohydrate intake and fat and pro - tein intake depending on the person’s or caregiver’s needs or preferences.

Typical multidose insulin treatment plans for adults with type 1 diabetes combine premeal prandial insulin with a longer- acting basal insulin. The long-acting basal dose is titrated to regulate overnight and fasting glucose. Postprandial glucose excursions are best managed by an appropriately timed injection or inhala - tion of prandial insulin. Prandial insulin should ideally be administered before meals, although the optimal timing de - pends on the pharmacokinetics of the for - mulation (regular, rapid-acting analog, or inhaled), the premeal blood glucose level, and the anticipated carbohydrate intake. Dosing recommendations should there - fore be individualized.

Noninsulin Treatments for Type 1 Diabetes Injectable and oral noninsulin glucose- lowering medications have been studied for their efficacy as adjuncts to insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes. Pramlintide is based on the naturally occurring β -cell peptide amylin and is approved for use in adults with type 1 diabetes. Clinical trials have demonstrated a modest reduction in A1C (0.3 – 0.4%) and modest weight loss ( ∼ 1 – 2 kg) with pramlintide ( 62 ). Similar results have been reported for several agents currently approved for the treat - ment of type 2 diabetes. The addition of metformin in adults with type 1 diabetes was associated with small reductions in body weight, insulin dose, and lipid levels but did not sustainably improve A1C ( 63 , 64 ). The largest clinical trials of glucagon- like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in type 1 diabetes have been conducted with liraglutide 1.8 mg daily, and results showed modest A1C reductions ( ∼ 0.4%), decreases in weight ( ∼ 5 kg), and reduc - tions in insulin doses ( 65 , 66 ).

In general, higher-efficacy approaches, including combination therapy, have greater likelihood of achieving treatment goals. Weight management is a distinct treat - ment goal, along with glycemic manage - ment, as it has multifaceted benefits, including reduction of A1C, reduction in hepatic steatosis, and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors ( 90 – 92 ). For individuals with type 2 diabetes who re - quire initiation or intensification of glucose- lowering therapy to achieve and/or maintain individualized glycemic goals and who do not have additional consid - erations informing choice of therapy beyond need for glucose lowering, metformin is a commonly used medi - cation that historically has been the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes ( 93 , 94 ). Metformin is effective and safe, is inexpensive and widely available, and reduces risks of microvascular complica - tions, cardiovascular events, and death ( 93 , 95 , 96 ). Metformin is available in an immediate-release form for twice-daily dosing or as an extended-release form that can be given once daily.

The drug is cleared by kidney filtration, and metformin may be safely used in people with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 ( 99 ). Very high circulating levels (e.g., as a result of overdose or acute kid - ney injury) have been associated with lac - tic acidosis ( 100 ). However, the occurrence of this complication is very rare ( 101 ) and primarily occurs when the estimated glo - merular filtration rate (eGFR) is < 30 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 ( 102 ). For people with an eGFR of 30 – 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , there is an increased risk for periodic decreases of eGFR to ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 which heightens the risk of lactic acidosis.

Thus, when choosing a glucose-lowering medication to achieve individualized gly - cemic goals, we recommend engaging in shared decision-making and considering factors such as glucose-lowering efficacy, the side effect profile, and medication ac - cessibility and affordability ( 108 ). In all cases, treatment plans need to be continuously re - viewed for efficacy, side effects, hypoglyce - mia, and treatment burden ( Table 9.2 ). When A1C is ≥ 1.5% above the indi - vidualized glycemic goal (see section 6, “ Glycemic Goals, Hypoglycemia, and Hyperglycemic Crises ,” for appropriate goals), many individuals will require dual- combination therapy or a more potent glucose-lowering agent to achieve and maintain their goal A1C level ( 90 ) ( Fig. 9.4 and Table 9.2 ). Insulin should be consid - ered as part of any combination medica - tion plan when hyperglycemia is severe, especially if catabolic features (weight loss, hypertriglyceridemia, and ketosis) are pre - sent.

As glucose toxicity resolves, simplifying the medication plan and/or changing to noninsulin agents is possible. Additionally, there is evidence that people with type 2 diabetes and severe hypergly - cemia can also be effectively treated with a sulfonylurea, a GLP-1 RA, or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, though evidence is scarce for individuals with baseline A1C above 10 – 12% ( 105 , 109 – 111 ).

Results from comparative effectiveness meta-analyses suggest that each new class of oral nonin - sulin agents when added to metformin generally lowers A1C by approximately 0.7 – 1.0% (8 – 11 mmol/mol). Addition of GLP-1 RAs or the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA to metformin usually results in 1% to ≥ 2% lowering of A1C ( 105 , 117 , 118 ) ( Fig. 9.4 and Table 9.2 ). Use of GLP-1 RAs (or the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA) together with a DPP-4 inhibitor is not recommended, as there is no added glucose-lowering ben - efit beyond that of the GLP-1 RA alone ( 119 – 121 ). When even greater potency of glucose reduction is needed, basal insulin, either human NPH or a long-acting insulin ana - log, should be initiated. However, if the individual is not already receiving GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA therapy, an agent from these classes should be started first, as it may be sufficient for achieving individualized A1C goals but with lower risk of hypoglycemia and with favorable weight, cardiovascular, kidney, and liver profiles.

GLP-1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA in these trials also had a lower risk of hypoglyce - mia and beneficial effects on body weight compared with insulin, albeit with greater gastrointestinal side effects. Thus, trial re - sults support high-potency GLP-1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA as the preferred options for individuals requiring more in - tensive glucose management ( Fig. 9.5 ). In individuals who are intensified to in - sulin therapy, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA has been shown to have greater efficacy and durability of glycemic treatment effects, as well as weight and hypoglycemia bene - fits, than treatment intensification with insulin alone ( 90 , 131 ). However, cost, ac - cessibility, and tolerability are important considerations for GLP-1 RA and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA use. In all cases, treatment plans need to be continuously reviewed for efficacy, side effects (including hypoglycemia), and treat - ment burden ( Table 9.2 ).

Individuals with type 2 diabetes are generally more insulin resistant than those with type 1 diabetes, require higher daily doses ( ∼ 1 unit/kg), and have lower rates of hypoglycemia ( 180 ). Meta-analyses of trials comparing rapid-acting insulin ana - logs with human regular insulin in type 2 diabetes have not reported meaningful differences in A1C or hypoglycemia ( 181 ). Titration of prandial insulin can be based on home self-monitored blood glucose or CGM. When significant additions to the prandial insulin dose are made, particu - larly with the evening meal, consideration should be given to decreasing basal insulin to reduce risk of hypoglycemia. When ini - tiating intensification of insulin therapy, metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 RAs (or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA) should be maintained, unless adverse effects (in - cluding significant treatment burden) or contraindications are present.

E Diabetes Technology and Glycemic Management The use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in adults with diabetes improves glycemic outcomes (e.g., A1C, time in range) and reduces episodes of hypogly - cemia in adults with diabetes who are on insulin therapy or other noninsulin therapies that can induce hypoglycemia ( 193 – 209 ). In addition, the use of AID systems should be offered to adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are on insulin therapy to improve glycemic management and glycemic outcomes ( 26 , 28 – 32 , 35 – 37 , 210 – 215 ).

The impact on gastric emptying with GLP-1 RAs and the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA is highest at initiation and with dosage increases and then diminishes with contin - ued administration ( 239 ).

This form of diabetes is most common after exposure to ICIs that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) (i.e., nivolumab and pem - brolizumab) and those that target pro - grammed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) (i.e., durvalumab and avelumab). ICIs that target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte – associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) (i.e., ipilimumab) have also been implicated in this process, but much less commonly ( 247 ).

Monitoring glucose levels solely in the morning may miss the extent of the hyperglycemia experienced due to glucocorticoid use and prevent appropriate management ( 263 , 265 – 267 , 272 ). Thus, glucose-lowering medication adjustments or additions should match the timing and extent of hyperglycemia and allow for rapid adjustment as the dose of the glu - cocorticoid dose changes to minimize the likelihood of hyperglycemia and hypogly - cemia. Insulin is the most frequently used glucose-lowering medication to manage hyperglycemia secondary to glucocorti - coid use. The selection of insulin type and dose depends on the dose and dura - tion of the glucocorticoid ( 265 , 266 , 269 , 272 – 275 ). Additions or dose adjustments of sulfonylureas, including meglitinides, have also been used for those with type 2 diabetes or no previous diagno - sis of diabetes.

The Comparing Glycaemic Benefits of Active Versus Passive Lifestyle Intervention in Kidney Allograft Recipients (CAVIAR) study compared active and passive lifestyles after kidney transplantation using be - havior therapy and found a statistically significant reduction in fat mass and weight loss with active lifestyle.

In another study of hypoglycemic episodes (defined as < 50 mg/dL [ < 2.8 mmol/L]), 78% of indi - viduals were taking basal insulin, with the incidence of hypoglycemia peaking between midnight and 6:00 A . M . ( 111 ). Despite recognition of hypoglycemia, 75% of individuals did not have their dose of basal insulin changed before the next basal insulin administration ( 111 ). Several groups have developed algorithms to pre - dict episodes of hypoglycemia in the inpa - tient setting ( 112 , 113 ). Models such as these are potentially important and, once validated for general use, could provide a valuable tool to reduce rates of hypogly - cemia in the hospital.

Overall evidence supports preadmission treat - ment of hyperglycemia in people sched - uled for elective surgery as an effective means of reducing adverse outcomes ( 139 , 140 ). Current data also suggest an optimal A1C goal between 7% and 8% preoperatively, as it is associated with better glycemic management in the perioperative period and decreased length of hospital stay ( 139 , 141 – 144 ). If available, 14-day CGM data with a glucose manage - ment indicator < 8% or time in range > 50% before elective surgery may be used in lieu of A1C as evidence of ade - quate preoperative glycemic management.

Therefore, if subcutaneous insulin administration is used, it is important to provide an ade - quate fluid replacement, frequent POC blood glucose monitoring, treatment of any concurrent infections, and appro - priate follow-up to avoid recurrent DKA. Several studies have shown that the use of bicarbonate in people with DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

PREVENTING ADMISSIONS AND READMISSIONS For people with diabetes, the hospital re - admission rate is between 14% and 20%, which is nearly twice that for people without diabetes ( 184 , 190 ). This may re - sult in increased diabetes distress and has significant financial implications. Of peo - ple with diabetes who are hospitalized, 30% have two or more days of hospital stays, and these admissions account for over 50% of hospital costs for diabetes ( 191 ). Factors contributing to readmission include male sex, longer duration of prior hospitalization, number of previous hospi - talizations, number and severity of comor - bidities, and lower socioeconomic and/or educational status; factors that may re - duce readmission rates include scheduled home health visits and timely ambulatory follow-up care ( 184 , 190 ). While there is no standardized protocol to prevent readmis - sions, several successful strategies have been reported that identify high-risk indi - viduals and offer some possible solutions ( 184 ).

Introduction The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) established the importance of glycemic management to reduce the risk of long-term complications in people with type 2 diabetes [1].

More recently, clinical trials have demonstrated that certain glucose-lowering medications can reduce cardiac and renal com- plications of diabetes in certain populations, beyond the effects of glucose lowering alone. We conducted a thorough review of the existing evidence to support people living with type 2 diabetes and their health-care providers in the selection of glucose-lowering agents. This review spanned the period from June 2020 to February 2023, and updates the last guideline published in 2020. This chapter focusses exclusively on pharmacologic glycemic management for type 2 diabetes in adults. Physical activity [2], nutri- tion therapy [3], self-management education and support [4], and weight management [5] are other important components of glycemic management for type 2 diabetes, and are discussed in their own chapters. Similarly, related topics, such as targets for glycemic man- agement [6], glucose monitoring [7], management of hypoglycemia [8], and remission of type 2 diabetes [9], are addressed in other chapters.

Metformin is the recommended fi rst-line antihyperglycemic medication for most people. The preference for metformin as the initial agent is based on its durable ef fi cacy in lowering A1C, absence of risk for hypo- glycemia or weight gain, relatively mild side-effect pro fi le, long- term safety track record, and affordability. Further, metformin monotherapy in newly-diagnosed participants who had over- weight in the UKPDS demonstrated CV and all-cause mortality bene fi ts [10]. Metformin monotherapy has comparable A1C- lowering effects to sulfonylureas, but better glycemic durability [11], negligible risk of hypoglycemia [12], no weight gain [12,13], and lower CV risk [13]. Metformin has better A1C lowering and weight loss than dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors [12,14]. To date, no studies have demonstrated superiority of SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP1-RAs, or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GIP/GLP1- RAs) over metformin as fi rst-line therapy in people newly diag- nosed with type 2 diabetes.

When considering pharmacotherapy intensi fi cation, health- care providers should fi rst assess for and address potential pre- cipitants of increasing A1C (e.g. infection, ischemia, concomitant medications, changes in eating or physical activity). They should also explore medication adherence and barriers to adherence, such as adverse drug effects, costs, beliefs, and preferences. After these assessments, dose adjustments and/or additional anti- hyperglycemic medications may be considered, with a goal of meeting the glycemic target within 3 to 6 months [29].

Maximum doses are often determined by renal function (eGFR), as indicated in Table 2. Simultaneous use of agents within the same class or with similar mechanisms of action (e.g. sulfonylureas and meglitinides; or DPP4 inhibitors, GIP/GLP1- RAs and GLP1-RAs) is not recommended. Several meta-analyses have summarized head-to-head com- parisons of metformin-based combinations [12,14,30 e 32].

The risk of hypoglycemia is lower with incretins, SGLT2 inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones compared to sulfonylureas and insulin [12,14,30 e 32,37,38]. Insulin, sulfonylureas, and thia- zolidinediones are associated with the most weight gain (1.5 to 5.0 kg), DPP4 inhibitors have a neutral effect on weight, while GIP/ GLP1-RAs, GLP1-RAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors lead to weight loss [12,14,30 e 32,39 e 42]. For the majority of people living with type 2 diabetes, for whom weight loss is a priority, treatment intensi fi - cation with a GIP/GLP1-RA or GLP1-RA may be preferred as they can induce weight loss and have negligible risk for hypoglycemia. SGLT2 inhibitors may also be preferred as they can also lead to some weight loss and have negligible risk for hypoglycemia.

Insulin Treatment With Type 2 Diabetes A combination of non-insulin antihyperglycemic agents and insulin is often effective to manage glucose levels. The insulin regimen in type 2 diabetes should be tailored to the individual to reach their individualized glycemic levels and to minimize risk of hypoglycemia.

Figure 2 summarizes a stepwise approach to insulin regimens for people with type 2 diabetes. As a fi rst step, a single daily injection of an intermediate-acting (NPH) [77] or long-acting insulin analogue (insulin glargine U-100, insulin glargine U-300, insulin detemir, or insulin degludec) [78 e 80] may be added, particularly for people with fasting hyperglycemia.

The basal insulin dose should be titrated to the fasting glucose levels; insulin requirements will likely increase as diabetes progresses, and higher doses may be needed over time. If glycemia is suboptimal on treatment regimens that include basal insulin with other agents, bolus insulin at mealtimes (short- or rapid-acting analogues) may be added. Generally, once bolus insulin is introduced into a treatment regimen, either as a separate mealtime bolus or as part of a premixed regimen, insulin secreta- gogues, such as sulfonylureas and meglitinides, should be dis- continued due to an increased risk for hypoglycemia. Concomitant therapy with metformin, incretins, and SGLT2 inhibitors should be continued with regimens containing bolus insulin to support gly- cemic management with less risk of weight gain and hypoglycemia [75,76,81 e 102]. Bolus insulin should be initiated using a stepwise approach, starting with 1 injection at the largest meal and then introducing additional mealtime injections later, if needed. This approach was shown to be as ef fi cacious at A1C lowering as a full basal-bolus regimen, but is associated with less hypoglycemia and greater satisfaction after 1 year [103].

Lower rates of hypoglycemia have been observed in some studies of individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with rapid- acting insulin analogues compared to those treated with short- acting (regular) insulin [104 e 107]. Use of long-acting basal insu- lin analogues reduces the relative risk of symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia compared to treatment with NPH insulin [104,108-110]. Insulin degludec is associated with lower rates of overall, symptomatic, nocturnal, and severe hypoglycemia compared to glargine U-100 [78,80,111 e 113]. There is also some evidence of lower hypoglycemia rates with glargine U-300 compared to glargine U-100 [114].

Using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we derived pooled estimates for each PICO question and appraised evidence certainty on an outcome-by-outcome basis. With GRADE, evidence certainty is appraised across 5 domains: risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, inconsistency, and publication bias. This extensive and detailed analysis is provided in the companion article. 7 We used a modi fi ed Delphi process in which panelists voted on and suggested re fi nements to draft statements to derive the fi nal statements. All con fl icts of interest were declared. For recom- mendations to go forward a two-thirds voting majority was required.

Screening The opportunity to help reduce cardiorenal morbidity and mortality through the use of diabetes-related drugs requires vigilance in identi fi cation of appropriate patients for therapy. Assessment of HF symptoms is commonplace and fosters appropriate use of imaging and biomarker tests to identify HF and its phenotype. Serum creatinine and eGFR are often measured to ensure appropriate CV drug dosing or in antic- ipation of diagnostic tests using contrast media. But measures of A1c and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) are often not included to identify patients who might well bene fi t from use of cardiorenal risk-reduction drugs. Consequently, we have included a general recommendation to undertake these tests as part of a comprehensive CV risk assessment. Moreover, digital health technologies might further facilitate Table 1.

No treatment interactions were noted among SGLT2i and these baseline therapies. 21 Treatment with SGLT2i showed no excess in hypovolemia, hypoglycemia, or renal side effects compared with placebo. A meta-analysis of the 2 trials shows that SGLT2i reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with symptomatic HFrEF, whether T2D is present or not. 33 The CCS/CHFS guideline was one of the fi rst worldwide to endorse SGLT2i as foundational therapy for patients with HFrEF in concert with angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/ angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), b -blocker, and mineralo- corticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). 5 Figure 1.

A diagnosis of CKD is made in people with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and/or random UACR \u0015 2.0 mg/mmol on at least 2 of 3 samples over a 3-month period. 6 Measuring eGFR and UACR on an annual basis (at a minimum) is recommended for patients with CV disease or multiple risk factors. The reviewed trials indicate cardiorenal bene fi ts of SGLT2i in patients regardless of dia- betes status. Among those living with CKD and T2D, it should be emphasized that reduction in the onset and pro- gression of CKD can also be enhanced by attaining optimal A1c and BP goals. For the latter, incorporation of an ACEi or an ARB is warranted. Moreover, even when patients with T2D and CKD have achieved A1c goals, one of the SGLT2i should be included to reduce risks of CKD progression, HF, and MACE. In patients with T2D and CKD who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of met- formin and SGLT2i, or who are unable to use those medi- cations, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines 6 recommend long-acting GLP-1RA.

The initial trial that used empagli fl ozin published in 2015, through to the most recent trial that used efpeglena- tide published in 2021 were evaluated in detail in the accompanying systematic review and meta-analysis. 7 Table 1 shows that MACE was reduced similarly by both classes with a relative risk reduction of 12%-14%. These classes were also associated with similar relative risk reductions in all-cause (12%-15%) and CV mortality (13%-15%). Reduction in nonfatal MI was noted only with SGLT2i but the effect was modest (10% relative risk reduction).

The choice of initial pharmacotherapy has emerged as an area of uncertainty in patients with newly diagnosed T2D who have or are at risk of ASCVD. Although most guidelines continue to recommend metformin as fi rst-line anti- hyperglycemic therapy, the European Society of Cardiology diabetes guideline 52 recommends that GLP-1RA or SGLT2i should be fi rst-line therapy in individuals with ASCVD or at high or very high CV risk. Although there have been no speci fi c trials to show cardiorenal bene fi t for GLP-1RA or SGLT2i when used as fi rst-line therapy or as monotherapy or in newly diagnosed T2D, the bene fi t seen in the CV outcome trials has not been found to vary with the duration of diabetes, suggesting that similar bene fi ts might be seen early in the course of disease. 4 The bene fi ts are also not dependent on the presence of metformin. 8,53-55 Therefore, the inclusion of GLP-1RA or SGLT2i at the time of diagnosis of T2D in patients with ASCVD or multiple risk factors is a reasonable option and aligns with the views of Diabetes Canada. 3,4 In addition, the traditional role of metformin in the early man- agement of T2D is not always appropriate if not tolerated or contraindicated (eg, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ).

In the SUSTAIN 6 trial of subcutaneous once weekly semaglutide, more retinopathy events occurred in the semaglutide group. However, this increase appears to be due to the rapid and robust glucose-lowering in people with marked hyperglycemia and preexisting retinopathy d a phe- nomenon previously observed in studies of insulin. In those patients, glucose-lowering is still desired but simultaneous regular examinations by an eye care professional is critical so that any changes can be addressed in a timely fashion. The long-term bene fi ts of glucose control on the eyes far outweigh any acute risk. The most common adverse effect of SGLT2i is genital mycotic infections (GMIs). Women (10%-15% risk), those with previous GMI, and uncircumcised men are at highest risk. GMI risk can be reduced with appropriate genital hy- giene strategies and when they occur, can typically be managed with antifungal drugs and do not require discon- tinuation of therapy. The risk of hypoglycemia is an important consideration if patients are using insulin secretagogues (meglitinides and sulfonylureas) and/or insulin (Fig. 2).

The risk of hypoglycemia is lower if A1c is > 8%. If SGLT2i are used in those with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 the risk is lower because the glycemic-lowering effect of SGLT2i is minimal. In contrast, for GLP-1RA, the potential for glucose- lowering is present across the eGFR spectrum. To decide if adjustment of existing insulin secretagogues and/or insulin is needed, consider the current A1c. If A1c is > 8%, then the addition of these agents is less likely to cause hypoglycemia but the patient should be counselled about the potential for hypoglycemia. However, if the A1c is \u0014 8%, then a reduction in the dose or discontinuation of the insulin secretagogue is warranted to avoid hypoglycemia.

The decrease in eGFR is expected and results from a decrease in intra- glomerular pressure induced by these agents, conceptually similar to what is seen with ACEi and ARB. In fact, trial evidence suggests that there is no increase or even a reduction in acute kidney injury. 61 Accordingly, this eGFR reduction should not result in premature discontinuation of SGLT2i, which favourably modi fi es kidney outcomes.

Introduction The fi rst iteration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) algorithm for glycemic control was pub- lished in 2009 and expanded on the visual guidance provided by the American College of Endocrinology (ACE)/AACE Diabetes Road Maps to help clinicians navigate the expanded classes of approved antihyperglycemic agents. 1,2 At that time, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, metformin, and sulfonylureas (SUs)/glinides were in use, with the addition of exenatide as well as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is). The next update was in 2013 with publication of the Comprehensive Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) Management Algorithm, which incorporated new sections on the management of overweight/obesity, dyslipidemia, and hyperten- sion (HTN). 3 Revisions to this fi rst iteration have been incorporated on a yearly basis through 2020, 4-8 and the task force is grateful for the contributions and framework provided by previous authors of the algorithm (see Acknowledgments).

Although bile acid sequestrants can reduce cholesterol, these agents may also increase TG levels and should be used cautiously in patients with elevated TG levels. In addition, TG levels and LDL-C levels may change as glycemic control improves, so the impact of initiation of anti- hyperglycemic therapy must be taken into account when consid- ering adding or titrating antilipid therapies.

Excessive alcohol consumption also contributes to dyslipidemia, particularly hypertriglyceridemia; minimization of alcohol consumption should be encouraged. Persons with dyslipi- demia should be provided with tools to promote weight loss with caloric deprivation if overweight/obese.

Intensify Therapy to Achieve Lipid Target In persons with T2D, additional laboratory testing of lipid levels should be undertaken at frequent intervals (every 6-12 weeks) to direct titration of the statin or addition of an adjunct therapy in order to achieve lipid targets; less frequent testing intervals can be considered once lipid goals are consistently achieved. If lipid targets cannot be achieved with maximally tolerated statin therapy, then the addition of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe (10 mg/day) should be considered.

Start an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor or Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angio- tensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered fi rst-line therapies for HTN in persons with T2D, particularly in those with DKD.

Although A1C is a key measure, insulin titration requires use of multiple glycemic parameters including FBG, premeal or 2-hour postprandial BG, and data from CGM, when available, including TIR, time below range, and GMI. 21 In general, targets for fasting and premeal glucose are < 110 mg/dL without hypoglycemia and can be individualized based on a person ’ s comorbidities and clinical status. The use of CGM is recommended for persons treated with insulin to optimize glycemic control while minimizing hypoglycemia. 20 Symptomatic Hyperglycemia Basal with or without prandial insulin treatment may be needed as initial therapy if the A1C is > 10% and/or glucose values are > 300 mg/dL, combined with catabolic symptoms, such as weight loss. If symptomatic hyperglycemia is present, a GLP-1 RA alone is not recommended as it requires titration and may delay glucose con- trol.

Stepwise addition of prandial insulin at 1 to 3 meals is recommended if additional glycemic control is required. Basal Insulin Initiation The dose of basal insulin can be based on A1C levels at the time of initiation. For an A1C < 8%, basal insulin can be started at 0.1 to 0.2 U/kg/day and for an A1C > 8%, 0.2 to 0.3 U/kg/day can be considered.

Fixed-dose GLP- 1 RA and basal insulin combinations also can provide improved glycemic control when basal insulin alone has not achieved targets. 159 Basal Insulin Titration Basal insulin should be titrated every 2 to 3 days to reach gly- cemic targets with a goal FBG of < 110 mg/dL without hypoglycemia.

The key vaccines recommended for patients with DM also are detailed in the 2022 AACE DM CPG. 9 Despite the evidence supporting effectiveness of vaccinations among patients with DM, most health care professionals (HCPs) do not routinely evaluate the vaccination status of their patients who rely on the HCP ’ s recommendations to get vaccinated. 180 This ","tf":{"11":1,"174":2,"176":1,"177":1,"178":1,"179":1,"180":1,"2022":2,"delivery":1,"and":7,"potential":1,"side":1,"effects":1,"contraindications":1,"for":6,"discussion":1,"of":5,"the":13,"evidence":2,"use":1,"these":3,"medications":1,"persons":3,"with":7,"obesity":1,"prediabetes":1,"or":1,"t2d":1,"clinician":1,"should":1,"consult":1,"aace":3,"clinical":1,"practice":1,"guideline":1,"developing":1,"diabetes":2,"mellitus":1,"comprehensive":2,"care":2,"plan":1,"vaccine":4,"recommendations":4,"preventable":2,"illnesses":1,"caused":1,"by":1,"bacteria":1,"viruses":1,"result":1,"in":3,"signi":1,"fi":1,"cant":1,"morbidity":2,"mortality":2,"worse":1,"outcomes":1,"among":3,"high":1,"risk":1,"populations":1,"like":1,"dm":5,"vacci":1,"nations":1,"are":3,"effective":1,"reducing":1,"severity":1,"associated":1,"related":1,"to":2,"ill":1,"nesses":1,"however":1,"rates":1,"vaccination":2,"suboptimal":1,"patients":4,"cdc":3,"advisory":1,"committee":1,"on":2,"immunization":1,"practices":1,"acip":2,"maintains":1,"updated":1,"reference":1,"age":1,"appro":1,"priate":1,"https":1,"www":1,"gov":1,"vaccines":2,"schedules":1,"supports":1,"from":1,"algorithm":1,"fig":1,"key":1,"recommended":1,"also":1,"detailed":1,"cpg":1,"despite":1,"supporting":1,"effectiveness":1,"vaccinations":1,"most":1,"health":1,"professionals":1,"hcps":1,"do":1,"not":1,"routinely":1,"evaluate":1,"status":1,"their":1,"who":1,"rely":1,"hcp":1,"get":1,"vaccinated":1,"this":1},"len":201},{"docId":"aace-2023","docTitle":"AACE 2023 Algorithm","file":"aace-2023-algorithm.pdf","page":17,"chunkId":"aace-2023-p17-c1","text":"he evidence supporting effectiveness of vaccinations among patients with DM, most health care professionals (HCPs) do not routinely evaluate the vaccination status of their patients who rely on the HCP ’ s recommendations to get vaccinated. 180 This re- sults in missed opportunities to increase uptake of preventive vaccines.
